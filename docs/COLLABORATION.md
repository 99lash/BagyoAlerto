### Branching Strategy

- **`main`** â†’ Stable production branch
- **`dev`** â†’ Integration branch (merged from all feature branches)
- **`feature/feature-name`** â†’ One feature per branch (e.g., `feature/checklist-ui`)
  
---

### Commit Message Conventions

Use clear prefixes:

- `feat:`     -> New feature
- `fix:`      -> Bug fix
- `style:`    -> UI/CSS only
- `docs:`     -> Update o README or other docs
- `refactor:` -> Code cleanup

---

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your assigned feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

2. **Make your changes**, regularly with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add checklist toggle"
   ```
   [see commit message conventions](#commit-message-conventions)


3. **Push your branch** to Github:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/checklist-toggle
   ```
   [see branching strategy](#branching-strategy)

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** from your feature branch sa github 
5. **Request a review** from another member or leader

---

### Avoid

- Committing directly to main / dev
- Leaving commented-out code or unused files
- Merging your own PR without review from a member or leader

---

### Project Issues or Feature Tracking Management
We use the GitHub Projects Kanban Board to manage tasks:
